// Store 

-- store basically Holds the state tree of your entire application / its a place where all the states of an application are stored
    The only way to change the state inside it is to dispatch an action on it,


// Reducers 
functions that take two args,   the current state and an action as arguments, and return a new state result
In other words, (state, action) => newState
eg function reducer(state,action){
    return state;
}
